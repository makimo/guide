# 1. Manage status of your own tickets

Being PM/TL can be busy - help your collegue by managing status of your tasks on your own.
For example, when preparing the pull-request, move the ticket to _In Review_ and when merged,
move it to _Testing_/_Done_.

# 2. Don't break existing features

 Regression sucks. When preparing a pull-request, find a few minutes to ensure that you're
 not breaking anything. _It's cheaper to invest time before making a pull to test than for
 your PL to test it afterwards._
