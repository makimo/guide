## JIRA

Guidelines and rules for managing and working on JIRA. Rules are *obligatory*, suggestions are suggestions.

### Ticket

_Rules:_
1. Help your TL/PM a bit and manage ticket status by yourself. For example, if a feature goes through
   pull review, change the status to "In review". When the feature is merged, don't forget to move it
   to "Done". The person responsible is the person writing the code. If a ticket was made by the QA, 
   the developer should manage the ticket too.
