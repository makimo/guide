## General recommendations

This document is a compilation of general tips and suggestions that
doesn't fit anywhere ele or deserve their own documents.

### Documentation line width

We strongly recommend following the convention of keeping documentation lines
(docstrings, comments for modules, functions, methods, classes etc.) shorter
than 72 characters.

Please note that 72-character width cap targets only comment sections
(not code itself). It's much more readable if the natural language describing
a function is shorter than the code itself.

For the code we recommend 70-80 (see for example `python.md`).
