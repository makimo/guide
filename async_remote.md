# Knowledge transfer

## Wiki checklist

### Index
  List and describe all the tools, services and things used in the project.
  
### Glossary
  List and describe most important and required-to-know concepts and terminology used in the project.
  This section should usually provide newly onboarded team members with important know-how on what means what in the project.
  Weird acronyms? Overloaded terms which mean different things in normal life? Proper names (_pl. nazwy wlasne_)? They all should be here.
  
### Description/guide for specific tools
  List and describe all developer, design or management tools used in the project.
  For example, if you're using Zeplin for UI design list it hear and mention what it's for (since not everyone will be familar at first).
  Are you using CodeClimate for static analysis? List it here. And so on.
  
  Also, if the tool requires some kind of usage protocol, or it's not obvious how it's used (e.g. Firebase/Sentry), it all should be described here.
  
### Who is who? Who is responsible for what? Where to go for know-how?
  List and describe team roles (both of our team and client's). Additionally, if in your team team-members are responsible for application/system/code components,
  it's a good place to list it here too.
  
### Project's gotchas and must-have know-how
  List and describe any project-specific knowledge that is required but doesn't fit other sections.
